Instructions for creating a portable development environment on a high performance USB drive.

I wrote a series of blog articles at http://duckspot.wordpress.com/ that I want to move into Github, and extend, and then hopefully publish via Github pages somehow.  I'm still learning may way around Github and Github pages.  Anyway, the first thing I think I need is [Git] as part of my portable development environment.

[Git]: Git.md
